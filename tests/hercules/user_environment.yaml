# Use this YAML file to specify environment variables to inject into the user
# endpoint processes.  Following standard process environment variables, any
# variables specified here will be strings to the processes, and there is no
# nesting -- this is a key-value description only.
#
# A couple of notes:
#
# - Values specified here will override any defaults (e.g., PATH)
#
# - Note that PATH is set to a sensible default, so typically won't need to
#   be manually specified
#
# - Three variables cannot be set here: HOME, USER, and PWD.  These are set
#   based on the user's GETENT(1) entry.
#
# Example:
#
#     PATH: /opt/bin:/other/dir/bin:/usr/bin
#     SITE_SPECIFIC_VAR: some site specific value
