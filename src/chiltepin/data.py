    Parameters
    ----------

    src_ep: str
        Name of the source endpoint for the transfer.  Can be a display name
        or a UUID string.

    dst_ep: str
        Name of the destination endpoint for the transfer.  Can be a display
        name or a UUID string.

    src_path: str
        Path to the file or directory on the source endpoint that is to be
        transferred.

    dst_path: str
        Path to the file or directory on the destination endpoint where the
        data is to be transferred.

    timeout: int
        Number of seconds to wait for the transfer to complete.

    polling_interval: int
        Number of seconds to wait between checking the status of the transfer

    client: TransferClient | None
        Transfer client to use for submitting the transfers. If None, one
        will be retreived via the login process. If a login has already been
        performed, no login flow prompts will be issued.

    recursive: bool
        Whether or not a recursive transfer should be performed

    dependencies: Future | None
        Future to wait for completion before running the transfer task. If
        None, the transfer will be run at the next available scheduling
        opportunity
